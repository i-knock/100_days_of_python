# 100 days of python
## General
- According to the quiz, I can start at day 32. However, I wanna try some GUI stuff, so may start earlier
  - Starting at _Day 15_, as it is intermediate level and I want to practice OOP.


## Day 15 (i.e. Day 1)
- Made the coffee machine code
- Learnt that
  - Python assignments are by _reference_, not a copy!
  - List comprehension can be more lines than simple loops.
  - Breaking out of a "second level loop" is very hard; it's better to refactor the code.
- Improvements
  - Also, make more and smaller functions. They simplify everything
  - Work dirtier and faster.
